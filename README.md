# SpotifyTrueFanTest
## Ideation
The prompt for this project was to use two APIs to create something "useful", and to work on it for two weeks. From there we looked at some different APIs to 
get a sense of what was out there. Once we had narrowed down to a couple of interesting APIs we started to brainstorm combinations that would work well together 
along with what project they would create. After that we just picked the one that sounded the most fun and had some interesting APIs to use.
## Planning
From here we started going over the logistics of how we were going to build this. It started with just clarifying what we needed to do and what we wanted to 
accomplish. This involved looking more deeply at the capabilities of the APIs so that we could brainstorm ideas that would work with it. It also involved 
assessing our own skills so that we did not try to do too much stuff out of reach. 
## Doing
Once we had everything planned out, we started to divide the work up. Initially I was going to work on the front end, since I knew how to set up a website on
Google App Engine. I hadn't built any front ends and so getting anything to work was a struggle. My partner was also struggling with the backend, getting OAuth 
to work was harder than expected. It was early on that we decided to switch roles, which ended up being a smart choice. While we each still ran into problems, they
didn't seem as difficult as before. Looking back, I'm not sure why we even started the other way around.  
Working with OAuth was a challenge at first, there were a lot of tiny details I wasn't expecting. But after some fiddling, looking at the API documentation, 
and asking some questions I was able to get it to work. Getting the information, I needed from the JSON wasn't too bad, I had experience working with them before.
Using the Genius API turned out to be a breeze, it was very easy to request and receive data from, which was a nice change in pace. 
The next challenge was coordinating how the data from the APIs would get used by my teammate on the front end. The data wasn't too complicated but unless you had 
worked on it and understood the formatting would be difficult to decipher. It also wasn’t much of a challenge, we just talked about how the data would be most 
usable on the front end—since working with data on the front end was harder than backend—and then I changed the data to be in that format.
## Results
The result worked pretty well, and I am happy with how it turned out. I learned lots of different skills while enjoying all the work that I did. It is not super 
polished but that was never the goal, we just wanted to build and learn. I do think that that backend turned out very well along with using Google App Engine. 
Deploying the latest version of it was also super satisfying. While most people can't use it (the Spotify API only allows authorized emails to log into our website 
since we are not "verified as safe". Which is a whole other process to get verified which we did not have time for) I am still glad that we picked the project that 
we did.
## Reflection
If I were to do it all over again there are only a couple things I would change. The biggest was the timing of the project. It started during the final week of 
instruction and then was due at the end of finals. This was a super busy time for my partner and I so finding time to work on the project was a challenge. If it 
was during a different period it would have made working on this for a bit each day much more manageable. The second was the format of displaying it. While I loved 
Google App Engine I think that hosting it on there wasn't the best choice. JavaScript is something we both were interested in but learning that on top of everything
else we need to do was too much. I'm not sure what other format we would have done it in, but something we were both more familiar in would have been good.
